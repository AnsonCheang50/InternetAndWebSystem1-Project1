# InternetAndWebSystem1-Project1
Website Page: https://ansoncheang50.github.io/InternetAndWebSystem1-Project1/HTML/Homepage.html

The purpose of the site is as a portfolio, a place to show off my previous projects

The structure is pretty basic, as it is 3 html pages, that is a homepage, about page, and project page, with the project page containing all the project placed all in a table

To update the website, you would need to download the code, and from there edit the code, and push it back onto gh-pages, and make sure it updates the page properly

W3School was used to create some element of the website
